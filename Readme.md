# Stock Market Price Predictor using Supervised Learning
# Aim
To examine a number of different forecasting techniques to predict future stock returns based on past returns and numerical news indicators to construct a portfolio of multiple stocks in order to diversify the risk. We do this by applying supervised learning methods for stock price forecasting by interpreting the seemingly chaotic market data.

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.

Python 3 Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy,streamlit.

## Data Overview

<strong> Data Source </strong> --> Dataset/

<strong> Data points </strong>--> 2517 rows

<strong> Dataset date range </strong> --> October 2011 to September 2021

<strong> Dataset Attributes: </strong>

* Close/Last - Close/Last Prices

* Volume - Volume of Stocks

* Open - Opening Prices of Stocks

* High - Highest Prices of Stocks

* Low -  Lowest Prices of Stocks

## Data Preprocessing

## DATA CLEANING

    Deleted "Unnamed:7" Column For "Nan" Values Parsed The Date attribute in "datetime64" data type. Checked For Duplicate Rows(Not Found).

## Naive Bayes

We are classifying the news articles such that our model helps in classifying the news articles to be a profit or a loss.
We are doing this by calculating the diff in closed price of present day with the previous day.
