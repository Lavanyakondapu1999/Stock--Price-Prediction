# Stock Market Price Predictor using Supervised Learning
# Aim
To examine a number of different forecasting techniques to predict future stock returns based on past returns and numerical news indicators to construct a portfolio of multiple stocks in order to diversify the risk. We do this by applying supervised learning methods for stock price forecasting by interpreting the seemingly chaotic market data.

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed following softwares and libraries in your machine before running this project.

Python 3 Anaconda: It will install ipython notebook and most of the libraries which are needed like sklearn, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, numpy, scipy,streamlit.
